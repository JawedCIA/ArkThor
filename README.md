# ArkThor
<p align="center">
 <strong> Safetly and Strength to an organization in Cyber Security Cyber Defence  </strong>
    <br />
 <p/>

Threat categorization is one of the biggest challenges that the security community faces today. Malwares are hidden using multiple layers of packers, obfuscators thus hiding from revealing its true identity unless unpacked. 
	Of late, it is also observed that the same codebase / framework is reused by multiple RAT builders and Backdoors. Some of these packers and obfuscators are also reused across multiple malware families.

This project aims at looking into the networking concept of these C2 communicating malwares and tries to parse the network packets and classify the threats based on the unique communication pattern used by these malware families. The rules also involve fingerprinting the TLS certificates used in the communication.

We initated this as Capstone project during our CSCD (Advanced Certification Program in Cyber Security and Cyber Defense) program 2022-2023 of IIT Kanpur, in association with TalentSprint.


<h3> We ArkThor team are committed to provide holistic view of Analyzed  File for threat categorization with rich details. </h3>

## Project Core Architect Idea
To keep the architect loosely coupled we have sandwich the ArkThor in 3 different layers as shown in below diagram.

### Core concept of ArkThor project is to make it,
1. Platform Independent using containerization
2. Scalable 
3. Microservice
4. Plug and Analyzed (for light weight anyone can just run Core layer using python command)
5. Easy to deploy 
6. Used open-source tech stack only
7. On UI Interpret the Analyzed results in such a way that even non-security can understand it. 

Most important we follow the below rule:
<h4>“Organization Don’t buy products, they buy Solution to their Problems….”</h4>
